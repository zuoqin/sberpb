Clojure in Sberbank Private Bank
====================================

Themes
====================================
### Language tools help us make better software
* Swagger API: APIs becoming self-describing
* Ubiquitous, lightweight, asynchronous logging
* Cross platform, distributed job scheduling.

### Priorities
* Maintainable software
* Composable/modular/reusable software
* Cheaper software

### Structures and approaches that are useful in "enterprisely" software to:
* Reduce latency
* Make code faster
* Make code safer/more robust

### Keeping things simple: functions, data types

### Clojure code everywhere: real time pricing, risk management, data analysis, regulatory systems, desktop and WEB GUIs, web services, algo pricing, plugins to C++, Java, C#, Excel

### Unusual mandate
1. Fast delivey
* Move fast: deliver in hours/days/weeks what used to take days/weeks/years
* Equivalent functionaliy 5 to >10 times cheaper and/or sooner

2. Robust systems
* Libraries, apps, services should just work. Even with porr latency and bandwidth; and little to no user training; when underlying systems fail, and when data formats change or break.
* Build systems the users trust

3. Automate everything
* No resources to do things manually so automate everything. Integration: releases, monitoring, reporting.
* Turn banking processes into API

4. Invent new things
* Build things that weren't seen as possible or hadn't been thought before.
* What can we build if we have typed Clojure APIs to the world?

5. Light weight specifications.
* Often working from verbal or informal spec. And at best from informal functional specs.
* Spec often refined/derived from Clojure implementation

6. Low maintenance requirement
* Little devops to support; make sure the systems support themselves
* Make future changes easier

7. High success rate
* Have to demostrably outperform. Be clearly more efficient.
* Don't be the incumbent

8.
