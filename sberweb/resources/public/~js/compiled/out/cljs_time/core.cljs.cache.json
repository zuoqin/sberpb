The core namespace for date-time operations in the cljs-time library.\n\n  Create a DateTime instance with date-time (or a local DateTime instance with local-date-time),\n  specifying the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond:\n\n    => (date-time 1986 10 14 4 3 27 456)\n    #<DateTime 1986-10-14T04:03:27.456Z>\n\n    => (local-date-time 1986 10 14 4 3 27 456)\n    #<DateTime 1986-10-14T04:03:27.456>\n\n  Less-significant fields can be omitted:\n\n    => (date-time 1986 10 14)\n    #<DateTime 1986-10-14T00:00:00.000Z>\n\n    => (local-date-time 1986 10 14)\n    #<DateTime 1986-10-14T00:00:00.000>\n\n  Get the current time with (now) and the start of the Unix epoch with (epoch).\n\n  Once you have a date-time, use accessors like hour and second to access the\n  corresponding fields:\n\n    => (hour (date-time 1986 10 14 22))\n    22\n\n    => (hour (local-date-time 1986 10 14 22))\n    22\n\n  The functions after? and before? determine the relative position of two\n  DateTime instances:\n\n    => (after? (date-time 1986 10) (date-time 1986 9))\n    true\n\n    => (after? (local-date-time 1986 10) (local-date-time 1986 9))\n    true\n\n  Often you will want to find a date some amount of time from a given date. For\n  example, to find the time 1 month and 3 weeks from a given date-time:\n\n    => (plus (date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))\n    #<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>\n\n    => (plus (local-date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))\n    #<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>\n\n  An Interval is used to represent the span of time between two DateTime\n  instances. Construct one using interval, then query them using within?,\n  overlaps?, and abuts?\n\n    => (within? (interval (date-time 1986) (date-time 1990)) (date-time 1987))\n    true\n\n  To find the amount of time encompased by an interval, use in-seconds and\n  in-minutes:\n\n    => (in-minutes (interval (date-time 1986 10 2) (date-time 1986 10 14)))\n    17280\n\n  Note that all functions in this namespace work with Joda objects or ints. If\n  you need to print or parse date-times, see cljs-time.format. If you need to\n  ceorce date-times to or from other types, see cljs-time.coerce."]
