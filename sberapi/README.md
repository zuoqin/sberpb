Haskell in Sberbank Private Bank
====================================

Themes
====================================
### Language tools help us make better software

### Type systems for:
* Maintainable softwrae
* Composable/modular/reusable software
* Cheaper software

### Structures and approaches taht are useful in "enterprisely" software to:
* Reduce latency
* Make code faster
* Make code safer/more robust

### Keeping things simple: functions, data types

### Haskell code everywhere: real time pricing, risk management, data analysis, regulatory systems, desktop and WEB GUIs, web services, algo pricing, plugins to C++, Java, C#, Excel

### Unusual mandate
1. Fast delivey
  * Move fast: deliver in hours/days/weeks what used to take days/weeks/years
  * Equivalent functionaliy 5 to >10 times cheaper and/or sooner
