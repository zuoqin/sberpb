Haskell in Sberbank Private Bank
====================================

Themes
====================================
### Language tools help us make better software

### Type systems for:
* Maintainable softwrae
* Composable/modular/reusable software
* Cheaper software

### Structures and approaches taht are useful in "enterprisely" software to:
* Reduce latency
* Make code faster
* Make code safer/more robust

### Keeping things simple: functions, data types

### Haskell code everywhere: real time pricing, risk management, data analysis, regulatory systems, desktop and WEB GUIs, web services, algo pricing, plugins to C++, Java, C#, Excel

### Unusual mandate
1. Fast delivey
* Move fast: deliver in hours/days/weeks what used to take days/weeks/years
* Equivalent functionaliy 5 to >10 times cheaper and/or sooner

2. Robust systems
* Libraries, apps, services should just work. Even with porr latency and bandwidth; and little to no user training; when underlying systems fail, and when data formats change or break.
* Build systems the users trust

3. Automate everything
* No resources to do things manually so automate everything. Integration: releases, monitoring, reporting.
* Turn banking processes into API
